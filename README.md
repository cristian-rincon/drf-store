# Store API

Simple store API, using Django REST Framework.

## How to use

I used pipenv as environment handler. Feel free to use any other.

You can find some useful commands to set up the application on localhost, just type ``make`` on the console and you will find:

```bash

admin               Create admin user 
commit              Commit changes 
install_dep         Install Python Dependencies from requirements.txt file 
migrations          Make models migrations 
run                 Test api 

```
